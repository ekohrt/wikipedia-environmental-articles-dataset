In Electrical systems, such as telecommunication, power electronics, industrial electronics, power engineering; electromagnetic interference (EMI) control  is the control of radiated and conducted energy such that emissions that are unnecessary for system, subsystem, or equipment operation are reduced, minimized, or eliminated. 
Note:  Electromagnetic radiated and conducted emissions are controlled regardless of their origin within the system, subsystem, or equipment. Successful EMI control with effective susceptibility control leads to electromagnetic compatibility.
