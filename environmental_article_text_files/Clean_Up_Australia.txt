Clean Up Australia Limited is a not-for-profit Australian environmental conservation organisation registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.The organisation has sponsored a yearly Clean Up Australia Day since 1990. On the first Sunday of March each year groups of citizens clean up rubbish at different clean up sites across the country. According to the organisation, more than a million people participate each year. Clean Up Australia Limited also supports other environmental efforts, including preventing waste in the environment.


== History ==
Clean Up Australia Day was first held in January 1989. The idea was born out of an Australian Bicentenary event, "Clean-Up Lake Macquarie", which was instigated in 1987 by Ivan Welsh as Mayor of Lake Macquarie. Then followed the local "Clean Up Sydney Harbour" event in 1989, organized by Ian Kiernan and Kim McKay, with more than 40,000 volunteers who collected some 5,000 tonnes of rubbish. The 1990 Clean Up Australia Day event was launched by the then prime minister, Bob Hawke, over the initial opposition of the then state premier, Nick Greiner. Greiner later reversed his position and offered his support for the event.Clean Up Australia has evolved into an organisation that works with community, government and businesses to provide practical solutions to help us all live more sustainably every day of the year.Today the organisation's focus is as much on preventing rubbish entering the environment as it is removing what has already accumulated there.
"The Rubbish Report" is produced each year from data collected by surveying participants. As of 1990, 94% of rubbish was from packaging. By 1993, the campaign was focusing more strongly on sorting the rubbish collected into recyclables, and Kiernan was using Clean Up Australia Day to advocate for changes to legislation surrounding reduction of packaging and returning packaging to companies. In 1994, over 8,000 sites were cleaned up as part of the day. In 2008, Kiernan put a focus on bottled water, advocating for the expansion of container deposit refunds in Australia. In 2012, sponsorship cutbacks and a drop in private donations caused the organisation to let go all of its paid staff.


== Clean Up the World ==
Clean Up the World was established in 1994 after Ian Kiernan and Kim McKay approached the United Nations Environment Programme, with an idea to take his Clean Up concept global.Clean Up the World is an international campaign that encourages communities to clean up, fix up and conserve their environment through the Clean Up the World Membership program.
A Clean Up the World weekend is held on the third weekend of September each year and, by 2007, the event attracted more than 35 million people from over 120 countries to volunteer.
