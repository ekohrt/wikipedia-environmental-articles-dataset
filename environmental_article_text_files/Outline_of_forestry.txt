The following outline is provided as an overview of and guide to forestry:
Forestry – science and craft of creating, managing, using, conserving, and repairing forests and associated resources to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human and environment benefits. Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands.  Forestry accommodates a broad range of concerns, through what is known as multiple-use management, striving for sustainability in the provision of timber, fuel wood, wildlife habitat, natural water quality management, recreation, landscape and community protection, employment, aesthetically appealing landscapes, biodiversity management, watershed management, erosion control, and preserving forests as 'sinks' for atmospheric carbon dioxide.


== Focus of forestry ==
Tree – organism, whose species, age, vitality, growth, health, and size, are considered individually or more often, as part of a whole;Forest – defined as either a geographic area or delineated by the general composition of individuals;Biome – ecologically defined by its forest structure, leaf types, tree spacing, and climate


== Branches of forestry ==
Agroforestry – integration of forests into agricultural systems in order to optimize the production and positive effects within the system and minimize negative side effects of farming
Boreal forestry – analyzes the particular challenges of forestry in the world's boreal regions
Close to nature forestry – theory and practice that takes the forest as an ecosystem and manages it as such. It is based on reduced human intervention, that should be directed to accelerate the processes that nature would do by itself more slowly.
Dendrology – involves the study and identification of economically useful tree species
Energy forestry – includes specifically managing for the production of energy from biomass or biofuel derived from a fast-growing species of tree or woody shrub
Forest ecology – studies the patterns and processes of a forest ecosystem
Forest economics – studies the impact of economics on forest management decisions
Forest hydrology – embodies the effects of changes in forest land use on the movement, distribution, and quality of water in the ecosystem
Forest mensuration – incorporates quantitative measurements of the forest stand to determine stand timber volume and productivity/health, and provides a basis off which management decisions can be made
Forest pathology – research of both biotic and abiotic maladies affecting the health of the forest or tree, primarily fungal pathogens and their insect vectors
Silviculture – is the art and science of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests to meet specific objectives
Social forestry – addresses human-forest interactions, and the importance of community-based natural resource management
Sustainable forestry – emphasizes forest management for long-term environmental, social, and economic sustainability
Tropical forestry – is particularly concerned with management and conservation of forests in the tropics
Urban forestry – entails the care and management of urban tree populations for the purpose of improving the urban environment
World forestry – examines forest conservation at a global level


=== Forest management ===
Forest management – comprises the overall administrative, economic, legal, and social aspects of forest regulation

Analog forestry – a management focus that seeks to establish a tree-dominated ecosystem that is similar in architectural structure and ecological function to the naturally occurring climax and sub-climax vegetation community
Bamboo cultivation – farming and harvesting bamboo for commercial purposes such as construction.
Community forestry – combination of  forest conservation with rural development and poverty reduction objectives, accomplished through instating a legal framework that favors profitable and sustainable forest management
Ecoforestry – emphasizes practices which strive to protect and restore ecosystems
Hardwood timber production – process of managing stands of deciduous trees to maximize woody outputTree breeding – method of genetically modifying/selecting forest stock for improved growth or vigor characteristicsMycoforestry – ecological forest management system implemented to enhance forest ecosystems and plant communities through the introduction of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi
Permaforestry – approach to the wildcrafting and harvesting of the forest biomass that uses cultivation to improve the natural harmonious systems. It is a relationship of interdependence between humans and the natural systems in which the amount of biomass available from the forest increases with the health of its natural systems.
Plantation forestry – industrial plantations are established to produce a high volume of wood in a short period of time. Some plantations are managed by state forestry authorities (for example, the Forestry Commission in Britain) and others by paper and wood companies (such as Weyerhaeuser, Rayonier and Plum Creek Timber in the United States, Asia Pulp & Paper in Indonesia).
Short rotation forestry – managing a forest that utilizes fast-growing species as a bio-based energy crop for use in power stations, alone or in combination with other fuels such as coalShort rotation coppice (SRC) – focus on species that are able to naturally regenerate through stump sprouts to maximize economic productivitySustainable forest management – emphasizes practices that maintain forest biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, and vitality, while continuing to fulfill relevant ecological, economic and social functions
Tree farm – a forest or woodland owned privately where timber crop production is a major management goal

Mean annual increment (MAI) – refers to the average growth per year a tree or stand of trees has exhibited at a specific age
Periodic annual increment (PAI) – describes the average annual change in tree diameter between the beginning and ending of a growth period, used more often than MAI for percental growth
Ecological yield -the amount of wood volume in any given year whose harvesting would be considered sustainable
Growth and yield modelling – entails the creation of models of prospective tree growth and harvest yield for management purposesEconomicsStumpage – the price charged by a land owner to loggers for the right to harvest standing timber on that land
Optimal rotation age – the age at which the harvesting of stumpage will generate the maximum revenue or economic yield


== Harvesting ==

Logging – cutting, skidding, on-site processing, and loading of trees or logs onto trucks or skeleton cars.  The term is sometimes used in a narrow sense to mean moving wood from the stump to somewhere outside the forest, usually a sawmill or a lumber yard. However, in common usage, the term may be used to indicate a range of forestry or silviculture activities...


=== Harvesting methods ===

Felling – process of cutting down a tree
Bucking – splitting of a felled and delimbed trees into logs
Scaling – measurement of felled trees to determine the volume of merchantable wood
Skidding – transportation of logs from the site of felling to the landing along the ground
Forwarding – transportation of logs from the site of felling to the landing above the ground, usually to minimize soil disturbance but limits the size or amount of logs that can be moved at once
Hauling – long-distance transportation of logs from the landing to their final destination, usually with a semi-truck but occasionally with a train
Woodchipping – grinding of logs into chips for engineered wood, mulch, paper, or fuel
Cut-to-length logging (CTL) – an expensive but efficient system where trees are felled, delimbed, and bucked to scale directly at the felling site
Cable logging – skidding using a wire cable attached to the felled trees, most common in areas with steep topographic relief, variations includeHigh lead logging – a cable is anchored to a tree at the top of the hill:
Skyline logging – a carriage is used alongside the main cable to provide leverageShovel logging – transport of multiple logs close to the logging road using a stationary loader, often used to minimize soil disturbance
Heli-logging – transport of logs from the forest to the landing via helicopter, most commonly used in inaccessible areas or to minimize impact on the soil
