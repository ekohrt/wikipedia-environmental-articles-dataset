Incorporated in 2001 and recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by the US Internal Revenue Service, Earth Rights Institute (ERI) takes an innovative approach to join education, advocacy and research in building ecologically, economically and culturally sustainable communities in some of the worldâ€™s poorest regions. Earth Rights Institute advocates a model of development that supports the re-localization of development expertise. ERI believes that, in order to empower communities of the global south to manage and direct their own development, strategies and expert knowledge must be conceived locally. ERI is a United Nations NGO affiliate for ECOSOC, UN Habitat, UNCSD, and UN Finance and Development, and has the following objectives:

Empower impoverished communities of the global south in managing and directing their own local development.
Bridge the divide between academic research in sustainable development and action in the field.
Build a culture of Peace by promoting cross-cultural collaboration and encouraging appreciation for cultural diversity.
Advance solutions to crucial global issues in African development and create awareness by supporting African Solidarity across the globe.
