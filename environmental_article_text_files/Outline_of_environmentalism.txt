The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to environmentalism, broad philosophy, ideology and social movement regarding concerns for environmental conservation and improvement of the health of the environment, particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the concerns of non-human elements. Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and/or improvement of the natural environment, and may be referred to as a movement to control pollution.


== What type of thing is environmentalism? ==

Environmentalism can be described as all of the following:

a philosophy – the study of knowledge and the nature of life
an environmental philosophy – a branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental workings of human's relation to the environment and our place in it
a branch of ethics – environmentalism concerns moral relationships and the intrinsic value of both humans and the environment
a branch of environmental ethics –  environmental ethics describes the moral aspects that connect humans and non humans concerning the environment and what obligations human species have to non human species
Ideology – a system of ideas that focus on environmental thought and form how one thinks about maintaining the environment
Political movement – environmentalists seek to both change and create policy concerning environmental issues in order to protect the environment from further harm
Social movement – as a collective group environmentalists seek to create social environmental change and protect environmental liberties through both radical and non radical ecological groups


== Environmental movement ==

Conservation movement – seeks to protect natural areas for sustainable consumption, as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use.
Environmental conservation – process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through reforestation, recycling, or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life.
Environmental health movement – dates at least to Progressive Era, and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with nutrition, preventive medicine, aging, and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the environment, or an early warning system for what may happen to humans
Environmental justice – movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to environmental racism and prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link "social" and "ecological" environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing de facto racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances.
Ecology movement – involves the Gaia theory as well as Value of Earth and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility.
Deep ecology – ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value.
Bright green environmentalism – currently popular sub-movement that emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity.
Anti-nuclear movement – opposes the use of various nuclear technologies.
