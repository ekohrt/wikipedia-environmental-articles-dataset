The inaugural National CleanUp Day was held in 2017 and had more than 225,000 volunteers. The 2018 event had over 1,500,000 volunteers, 14 million pounds of waste collected, and was held in conjunction with the inaugural World Cleanup Day.The 2019 cleanup received nearly two million volunteers and resulted in the collection of 18 million pounds of waste. The U.S. event is coordinated with World Cleanup Day and saw a combined 20 million volunteers in 170 countries, which is the largest, single day global volunteer event. Beginning in 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation participated in cleanups on their local and interstate highway systems.In April 2019, Earth Day partnered with National CleanUp Day and Keep America Beautiful for the inaugural Earth Day CleanUp and had over 500,000 volunteers working to clean up trash and litter nationally. In 2020, the Great Global CleanUp by Earth Day was originally planned to include thousands of large group cleanups but most events were cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Earth Day and presenting partners World CleanUp Day, National CleanUp Day and Keep America Beautiful organized individual activities like Plogging and the TrashTag Challenge.In 2020, National CleanUp Day introduced the Tailored CleanUp program for businesses and cities. The program is available to any participating business, educational institution, land manager, government entity or nonprofit. The Tailored CleanUp page may be used for any cleanup activity on any date in the United States, Canada, India or China. The Join a CleanUp, cleanup mapping pages, and reporting pages may be used for any cleanup worldwide on any date. National CleanUp Day pivoted in 2020 due to COVID-19 from large scale cleanups to individual cleanups. They had over 671,000 signups by individuals, municipalities, schools, and companies.
