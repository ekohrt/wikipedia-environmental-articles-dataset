The majority of these diseases are degenerative and affect children and young adults. Characteristics include suboptimal heart and muscle function, speech problems and developmental delays. Dysfunctional mitochondria are associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxias, diabetes and cancer.


=== Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology ===
The center is headed by Prof. Bruce Rittmann. The center is focused on environmental biotechnology by producing fundamental and applied scientific concepts, technologies, and field-leading people. Taken together, they improve a broad range of human-generated and natural environments, inform the human-environment relationship, and promote a more sustainable future.


=== Biodesign Center for Environmental Health Engineering ===
The center is headed by Prof. Rolf Halden. The center is focused on safeguarding human health and critical ecosystems by detecting, minimizing, and ultimately eliminating harmful chemical and biological agents through the design and implementation of cost-effective engineering, industry engagement and public policy.


=== Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics ===
The center is headed by Prof. Ferran Garcia Pichel. The center is focused developing an integrated understanding of microbiomes. Our goal is to establish general functional principles that can explain and predict the behavior of microbial communities for a variety of applications.


=== Biodesign Center for Health Through Microbiomes ===
The center is headed by Prof. Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown. The center fundamental knowledge to develop microbe-based health interventions and diagnostics for better human health. Using fundamental microbiomes knowledge, we create methods to identify and track gut microbes and their products and develop microbial interventions for better human health.


=== Biodesign Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy ===
The center is headed by Prof. Grant McFadden. The center focuses on understanding how microbial pathogens cause disease and the cellular and systemic mechanisms used by animal and human hosts to respond immunologically to pathogens and vaccines.


=== Biodesign Center for Innovations in Medicine ===
The center is headed by Prof. Stephen Albert Johnston. The center focuses on to developing technologies that could transform health care. Our developmental process involves five steps. We first perform an extensive physical economic analysis of a potential intervention. Second, we analyze the logical, versus biological, opportunities. Third, we review the history of science in the area to identify flaws in analysis. Fourth, we determine if we have an inventive idea that would transform the area. Finally, we define a critical experiment to determine if our invention is viable. This is a teachable process that we impart to students and others. In addition, we require all our inventions to create products that everyone in the world could afford.


=== Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution ===
The center is headed by Prof. Michael Lynch. The center focuses on the specific mechanisms that govern evolutionary change, starting with the building blocks of cells. Our goal is to decipher the general rules by which evolution proceeds in different lineages of organisms using experimental laboratory results and a mathematical framework. In essence, we are aiming to establish an entirely new field called evolutionary cell biology.


=== Biodesign Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics ===
The center is headed by Prof. Hao Yan. The center is designing biomimetic materials at the molecular level to develop a versatile biomimetic toolbox. Our immediate goal is to engineer an array of intelligent materials spanning scales from angstrom to macro. We are laying the foundation for a new field of research informally referred to as “angstrom technology.” The power of information-coded angstrom technology, a transformative extension of nanotechnology, lies in the potential to mimic nature's way of controlling molecular interactions with angstrom spatial resolution.


=== Pathfinder Center ===
The center is headed by the Nobel prize winner Prof. Leland Hartwell. The center is focused on preparing educators and learners for the future by helping them find motivation and direction where education, health, technology, and sustainability meet.


=== Biodesign Center for Single Molecule Biophysics ===
The center is headed by Prof. Stuart Lindsay. The center is focused on the confluence of molecular medicine and nanotechnology. Nanotechnology allows researchers to study the physical processes on which life is based using the simplest model systems – those that exist on the level of a single molecule or several molecules, but also to unravel fundamental biological processes on the cellular and tissue level. Doing so allows for a better understanding of gene regulation, molecular and cellular signaling, molecular transport in cells and tissue, and will lead to improved biosensors and other new technologies.


=== Biodesign Center for Sustainable Macromolecular Materials and Manufacturing ===
The center is headed by Prof. Tim Long. The center is focused on integrating the concepts of green chemistry and sustainable engineering practices across the continuum of materials innovation to provide the products we need for a sustainable life. Efforts will utilize additive manufacturing processes and focus on multiphase systems. The center will embrace a “molecules to manufacturing” paradigm to catalyze innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit.


=== Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics ===
The center is headed by Prof. Joshua LaBaer. The center is focused on driving the discovery and development of biomarkers for the early detection of diseases. With better disease detection and earlier treatment, we strive to have a profound impact on decreasing mortality caused by various diseases including cancer and autoimmune diseases.

== Landscape ==
Designed by Ten Eyck Landscape Architects as a "green gateway" to the research facility set within the desert the landscape of the Biodesign Institute uses harvested stormwater and condensate to function as a riparian area. The 4-acre site aims "to create an environment that is about healing and sustaining life". TELA achieved this by replacing the prevalent asphalt with "permeable, vibrant, shade-giving regional gardens with plants used for healing purposes", using recycled water to feed these gardens, and most importantly "connecting people in an urban setting...with the natural beauty of our long ago altered Sonoran Desert". Beyond the gardens, the site features bike lanes, pedestrian malls, seatwalls, and bioswales that all function to bring people into contact with each other and nature. Upon completion, the project won an ASLA Honor Award in the General Design Category in 2009.
