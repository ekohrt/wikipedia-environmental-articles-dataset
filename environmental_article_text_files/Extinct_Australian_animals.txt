This is a list of Australian species extinct in the Holocene. This list only covers extinctions from the Holocene epoch, a geologic epoch that began about 11,650 years before present (about 9700 BCE) and continues to the present day. Species that were thought to be extinct and were rediscovered, called Lazarus taxa, are not covered in this article. Extinct subspecies of living species are also excluded. Locally extinct species (species that disappeared from Australia but survive overseas) are also outside of the scope of this article.
The list below includes a total of:

32 mammal species (25 from mainland Australia), including 31 extinct and one possibly extinct.
Ten extinct bird species (one from mainland Australia)
Two reptile species (one from mainland Australia), including one extinct and one possibly extinct.
Five amphibian species (all from mainland Australia), including three extinct and two possibly extinct.Several invertebrate species have also been listed as extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, this list is less exhaustive, since invertebrates are more difficult to survey and are less well studied.
All of these extinctions occurred after the European settlement of Australia, which began with the First Fleet in 1788 CE, although the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was extirpated from mainland Australia about 2,000 or 3,000 years ago. Thylacines were restricted to Tasmania by the time of European settlement, and the last known individual died in 1936.
