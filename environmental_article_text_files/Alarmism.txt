Alarmism is excessive or exaggerated alarm of a real or imagined threat. Alarmism connotes attempts to excite fears or giving warnings of great danger in a manner that is amplified, overemphasized or unwarranted. In the news media, alarmism can often be found in the form of yellow journalism where reports sensationalise a story to exaggerate small risks.


== Alarmist personality ==
The alarmist person is subject to the cognitive distortion of catastrophizing â€“ of always expecting the worst of possible futures.They may also be seeking to preserve feelings of omnipotence by generating anxiety, apprehension and concern in others.


== False accusation ==
The charge of alarmism can be used to discredit a legitimate warning, as when Churchill was widely dismissed as an alarmist in the 1930s.
