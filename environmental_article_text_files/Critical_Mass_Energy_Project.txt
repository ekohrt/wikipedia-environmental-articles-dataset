The Critical Mass Energy Project was formed by Ralph Nader in 1974 as a national anti-nuclear umbrella group. It was probably the largest national anti-nuclear group in the United States, with several hundred local affiliates and an estimated 200,000 supporters. Part of Nader's support comes from a Green agenda and the belief that "the most important office in America for anyone to achieve is full-time citizen." The organization's main efforts were directed at lobbying activities and providing local groups with scientific and other resources to campaign against nuclear power.The first national anti-nuclear conference, "Critical Mass '74" was held in Washington D.C. under the sponsorship of Ralph Nader. Workshops were held and groups throughout the United States learned about forming anti-nuclear organizations. At about the same time, Karen Silkwood, a nuclear plant worker, was killed in a car accident while investigating her nuclear energy company. There was speculation that the accident may have been intended.The second Critical Mass conference was held in November 1975, and this involved a candlelight vigil in front of the White House for Karen Silkwood.
